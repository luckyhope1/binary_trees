### 0x1D. C - Binary trees
---
### Collaborative Project ###
----
### Resources
----
### Read or watch:
1. Binary tree (note the first line: Not to be confused with B-tree.)
2. Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree
3. Tree Traversal
4. Binary Search Tree
5. Data structures: Binary Tree

### Requirements
---
### General
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
6. You are not allowed to use global variables
7. No more than 5 functions per file
8. You are allowed to use the standard library
9. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
10. The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called [binary_trees.h](binary_trees)
11. Don’t forget to push your header file
12. All your header files should be include guarded
